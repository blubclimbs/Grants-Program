# Jutsu Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Mintbase template development experience enhancement with Jutsu
- **Team Name:** Jutsu
- **Payment Address:** jutsuai.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview

### Overview

**Mintbase templates** are a compilation of web3 project examples on Near Protocol, providing developers with starter projects and practical use cases. Currently the number of templates are limited and need more community/developer involvement.

**Jutsu** is an AI powered developer platform where developer can leverage our WebIDE and Copilot to build any DApp 10X faster.

The purpose of this project is to build the best developer experience that will empower anyone to build and contribute to Mintbase templates.

Here are the steps (DEVX):

- Step 1: User can search for templates in Mintbase template library (https://templates.mintbase.xyz/) or in Jutsu template library (https://app.jutsu.ai/templates)
- Step 2: When user find a template they want to use the will click “Open in Jutsu” button in Mintbase template library.

- Step 3: User will get a “clone” of the template in their Jutsu account. They will be able to build and deploy there DApp from within Jutsu.

- Step 4: User will be able to deploy their DApp in IPFS, Arweave and NEARFS using Web4
- Step 5: (TBD) User will be able to deploy their DApp as BOS (RoC) in Near Social

> BOS (RoC) implementation depends on the stability and release of the BOS Web Engine by Pagoda team.

### Ecosystem Fit

Jutsu, with our AI powered Web3 IDE, slots perfectly into the Mintbase ecosystem, making it easier for developers and founders to use and deploy Mintbase templates. By incorporating Mintbase's extensive template library directly into Jutsu, we offer a dual advantage:

- Users can now open Mintbase templates within the Jutsu platform, and benefit from our comprehensive suite of developer tools.
- Users will be able to take advantage of Jutsu’s advance WebIDE features like copilot, code generation, debugging, and doc generation, generative UI, and Google Docs-style collaboration for teams.

This strategic integration aims to provide Mintbase users with an effortless start and an enriched coding and deployment experience through Jutsu, ultimately elevating the developer experience within the Mintbase and broader NEAR ecosystem.

Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?

We are not aware of any similar project in the Mintbase/NEAR ecosystem.
